## Overview
This project is written in TypeScript, I added a small extra setup to support compilation and testing. I used a standard tsconfig.json to compile the TypeScript source into a dist/ directory.
For testing, I leveraged Node 22's built-in test runner to support assertions and coverage. This approache keeps the solution lightweight, dependency-free, and easy to run with a single command.

Extra Setup Included

* Initialized TypeScript for type-safe development
* Compiled .ts files into dist/ output folder
* Added a minimal test/ directory with Node’s native test runner
